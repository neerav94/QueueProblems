Queue(Introduction)
Like Stack, Queue or First In First Out(FIFO) is a linear data type which has a collection of elements which performs the following basic operations:
a) insert: inserts the element on the top of the queue. If the queue is full it is called an overflow condition.
b) remove: removes the element from the queue which was inserted first of all. If the queue is empty it is called underflow condition.

The basic difference between stack and queue is that stack removes the element which was last inserted in the stack while queue removes that element which was inserted first.
The practical example of queue is the line of people waiting for ticket reservation at railway station. One who comes first will be given the ticket first.
The following is the stack implementation using array.
