/*Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends. The following operations are supported:
insertFirst(): Inserts the element in the begining of the queue
insertLast(): Inserts the element at the end of the queue
deleteFirst(): deletes an element from the start of the queue
deleteELast(): deletes an element from the end of the queue

Here is a doubly-linkedlist implementation*/
